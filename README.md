# Aframe example project
Feeling confident with my skills I've decided to try out using A-frame to make 3d renders.
I wanted to make each ball the size of their currency, but soon found out that bitcoin would overshadow the others.
Also I've ran into a difficulty of not being able to render in window, so if you'd like to try it out you have to 
`gatsby develop` in order to run it, you should also install gatsby-cli globally `npm i -g gatsby-cli`
